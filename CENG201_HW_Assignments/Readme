Q-1)In this project,I used a singly linked list structure to manage patients admitted to the  hospital.
I know that a linked list provides a more flexible structure compared to arrays,so,I benefited from the dynamic memory
usage offered by the linked list.Unlike arrays,a linked list doesn't require shifting elements during insertion and
deletion operations.This makes it very suitable for hospital systems where patient information changes frequently.
In the addPatient,the time complexity is Big O(1).This method adds a new patient to the end of the list.Since a tail
reference is maintained in the implementation,there is no need to traverse the list from the beginning to the end.The
new patient is added directly to the end of the list.Therefore,the insertion time remains constant even as the number of
patients increases,which meets the expected performance.
The removePatient removes a patient with a given ID from the list.Although the deletion operation itself is performed in
constant time,finding the patient requires searching from the beginning of the list.In the worst case,the patient may be
located at the end of the list or may not exist at all.For this reason the time complexity of this method is O(n).
FindPatient also performs a linear search based on the patient IS.Since each node is checked one by one,the entire list
may be traversed in the worst case.Therefore,the time complexity of this method is O(n).
Q-2)When comparing LinkedList and ArrayList,ArrayList allows fast access using indices.
However,when an element is removed,the remaining elements must be shifted,which is costly.Linked List more efficient for
deletion operations due to its flexible structure.For this reason,I preffered linked List.
Q-3)The queue data structure works according to the FIFO(First in First Out)prinicple,which means that the first element
added to the queue is the first one to be removed.This structure ensures that patients who arrive at the hospital are
treated in the order of their arrival.In real life hospitals operate in the same way,where the patient who comes first
is treated first.For this reason,the queue structure is very suitable for managing treatment requests.
When a treatment request is added to the system,it is placed at the end of the queue using the enqueue operation.The
patient whose treatment will begin is removed from the front of the queue using the dequeue operation.Since these
operations don't require traversing the queue,both of them have a time complexity ofO(1).This allows the system to
operate quickly and efficiently.Additionally,this structure creates a fair system where patients are treated equally and
no patient is disadvantaged.
Q-4)The stack data structure works according to the LIFO(Last in,First Out)principle,which means that the last element
added to the system is the first one to be removed.If treatment requests were managed using a stack,the patient who
arrived last would be treated first.This situation would cause patients who have been waiting for a long time to be
continuosly delayed,resulting in an unfair system.Such a structure is not suitable for real hospital operations and may
even cause some patients to never receive treatment.Although insertion and removal operations in a stack also have a
time comlexity of O(1),the problem here is not related to performance but to the behavioral nature of the data structure
For this reason,using a queue to manage treatment requests is a more logical and realistic choice.
Q-5)In this task I used a Stack data structure to manage the records of discharged patients.The stack structure works
according to the LIFO(Last in First Out)principle,which means that the most recently added record is removed first.tHİS
feature is very suitable for discharge operations because,in hospitals,it is usually necessary to access the information
of the most recently discharged patient more quickly.After a patient is discharged,possible checks or error situations
my occur,and in such cases,the most up-to-date record is examined first.In a stack structure,these record are kept at
the top so they can be accessed quickly usind peek and pop operations.Additionally new discharge records are added to
the system using the push operation.All of these operstions have a time complexity of O(1) which allows the system to
work efficiently.
Q-6)If a queue(FIFO) structure were used to manage discharge records,the first discharge patient would be processed
first.In this case,accessing the most recently discharged patient would become more difficult and reaching up-to-date
records would take longer.This structure is not suitable for the nature of discharge operations.Although insertion and
removal operations in both Stack and Queue have similar time complexities,the main difference between them lies in their
behavioral structure rather than performance.
